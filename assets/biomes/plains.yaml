# === PER-BIOME HEIGHT VARIATION (Agent 28) ===

height_variation_min: 2.0    # Very flat terrain
height_variation_max: 8.0    # Gentle rolling hills
height_noise_frequency: 0.008 # Low frequency = smooth, gentle terrain

# === TERRAIN ROUGHNESS CONTROL (Agent 29) ===
terrain_octaves: 3           # Fewer octaves = smoother, less detail
terrain_lacunarity: 2.0      # Standard lacunarity for gentle rolling hills
terrain_gain: 0.4            # Lower gain = less detail persistence (smoother)
terrain_roughness: 15        # Explicit roughness: 15/100 = very smooth, flat terrain
