# Mountain Biome
# Tall, rocky terrain with sparse vegetation and high elevation

# Required properties
name: "Mountain"
temperature: 35        # Cold (high altitude)
moisture: 40           # Low-moderate
age: 20                # Young, rough, jagged terrain
activity: 30           # Low structure spawning (hard to build on mountains)

# Vegetation
trees_spawn: true
tree_density: 25       # Sparse trees at lower elevations
vegetation_density: 30 # Limited vegetation

# Spawning
spawn_location: "AboveGround"
lowest_y: 70           # Higher base elevation
biome_rarity_weight: 35  # Somewhat uncommon
river_compatible: true   # Rivers flow down mountains

height_multiplier: 3.5   # 3.5x taller for dramatic mountains (reaches Y=110+)

# === PER-BIOME HEIGHT VARIATION (Agent 28) ===
base_height_offset: 20       # Mountains start 20 blocks higher than sea level
height_variation_min: 15.0   # Minimum terrain roughness
height_variation_max: 50.0   # Maximum terrain roughness (very jagged peaks)
height_noise_frequency: 0.025 # High frequency = sharp, jagged terrain
valley_depth: -10            # Create mountain valleys
peak_height: 30              # Create towering peaks (+30 blocks at highest points)

# === TERRAIN ROUGHNESS CONTROL (Agent 29) ===
terrain_octaves: 7           # More octaves = more detail (rough, jagged peaks)
terrain_lacunarity: 2.5      # Higher lacunarity = sharper features
terrain_gain: 0.6            # Higher gain = persistent detail across octaves
terrain_roughness: 90        # Explicit roughness: 90/100 = very rough terrain

# Primary blocks

# === BIOME INFLUENCE FALLOFF CUSTOMIZATION (Agent 23) ===
# Mountains use wider, gentler transitions due to large scale
