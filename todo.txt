# TODO List
# Extracted from code comments

## Main Menu / Save System
- src/main.cpp:268 - Implement load game functionality
- src/main_menu.cpp:78 - Implement save/load system

## Water/Liquid System
- src/main.cpp:743 - Implement dirty list of changed water blocks instead of full world scan
  Current implementation scans ALL 432 chunks × 32,768 blocks = 14M blocks per update
- src/world.cpp:1120 - Update rendering to show water height based on level (currently all water renders at full height)
- src/world.cpp:1134 - Track water-containing chunks for even better performance
- src/world.cpp:1284 - Track water level changes in simulation and spawn particles

## Biome/World Features
- src/world.cpp:399 - Add mushrooms, glowing flora, etc. to underground biomes

## Future Enhancements
- src/player.cpp:174 - Sprint toggle mode could be added by adding a sprint_toggle_mode config option in config.ini
- src/world.cpp:844 - Block break animations could be added by adding a callback parameter to setBlockAt function
