# Voxel Engine

A modern voxel-based game engine built with **Vulkan**, featuring procedural terrain generation and first-person camera controls.

## Features

✨ **Vulkan Rendering**
- Modern graphics API with high performance
- Efficient GPU buffer management
- Back-face culling for optimized rendering

🌅 **Dynamic Sky System**
- Natural blue sky cube map with dynamic day/night transitions
- Minecraft-style 24000-tick day/night cycle (20 minutes)
- Procedural square sun and moon (voxel aesthetic)
- Baked star field with twinkling animation (red, blue, white stars)
- Dreamy dawn/dusk gradients (orange, pink, purple)
- Time-based fog and ambient lighting
- Console commands for time control (`skytime`, `timespeed`)

🌍 **Procedural World Generation**
- Massive worlds: Up to ±1 billion chunks per axis (±34 billion blocks)
- Dynamic chunk streaming for infinite exploration
- Configurable world size and seed
- Chunk-based rendering system (32×32×32 blocks per chunk)

🧱 **Advanced Block & Texture System**
- **Cube map textures**: Different textures for each face of a block
- **Texture atlas**: All textures packed into a single GPU texture
- **YAML-based block definitions**: Easy block creation and modification
- **Texture variation**: Random texture offsets for natural appearance
- **Backwards compatible**: Supports both single-texture and multi-face blocks

🎮 **First-Person Controls**
- WASD movement with sprint
- Mouse look camera
- Physics-based player movement
- Noclip mode for flying

🎨 **User Interface**
- ImGui integration
- Dynamic crosshair with targeting system
- Pause menu with Resume/Quit options

🎯 **Targeting System**
- Unified block targeting and outline rendering
- Rich target information (block name, type, position, distance)
- Context-aware input management
- Debug overlay for target details

🖥️ **Developer Console**
- Source engine-style console (F9)
- Command system with Tab autocomplete
- Console variables (ConVars) with persistence
- Debug overlays (FPS, position, target info)
- Markdown documentation viewer

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Windows**: Visual Studio 2019+, Vulkan SDK, CMake 3.10+
- **Linux**: GCC 7+, Vulkan development libraries, GLFW3, CMake 3.10+

### Building

#### Windows
```cmd
build.bat
run.bat
```

#### Linux
```bash
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

For detailed build instructions, see [docs/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](docs/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **W/A/S/D** | Move forward/left/backward/right |
| **Mouse** | Look around |
| **Space** | Jump (or swim up in water) |
| **Shift** | Sprint (hold) / Swim down |
| **N** | Toggle noclip mode |
| **F9** | Open developer console |
| **ESC** | Pause menu / Close console |
| **Left Click** | Break block |

For more details, see [docs/controls.md](docs/controls.md)

## Configuration

Edit `config.ini` to customize:
- World seed
- World dimensions (width, height, depth in chunks)
- Rendering and streaming settings

Example:
```ini
[World]
seed = 1124345
# Each dimension is in chunks (1 chunk = 32×32×32 blocks)
# Example: 4096×64×4096 chunks = 131km × 2km × 131km world
world_width = 4096
world_height = 64
world_depth = 4096
render_distance = 256.0
load_distance = 256.0
```

**World Size Limits:**
- Theoretical maximum: ±1,073,741,823 chunks per axis
- Maximum world: ~64 billion blocks per axis
- Practical limits depend on memory and streaming performance
- Recommended: Use streaming for worlds > 1000×1000 chunks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Black screen or crash on startup:**
- Make sure shaders are compiled (see build instructions)
- Update graphics drivers
- Verify GPU supports Vulkan with `vulkaninfo`

**Controls feel wrong:**
- Check if mouse is captured (click on window)
- Press ESC twice to ensure game is not paused

**Build errors:**
- Ensure Vulkan SDK is installed
- Restart computer after Vulkan SDK installation (Windows)
- Check all dependencies are installed (Linux)

For more troubleshooting, see the build instructions for your platform.
